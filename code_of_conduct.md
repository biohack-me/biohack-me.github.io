# Code of Conduct

Everyone participating in the Biohack.me community— including, but not limited to the Biohack.me [forums](https://forum.biohack.me/){:target="_blank"}, [Slack channel](https://grindsyndicate.slack.com/){:target="_blank"}, and events like Grindfest— is required to agree to the following Code of Conduct.

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of community members in any form.

Anyone who violates this Code of Conduct may be sanctioned or banned from these spaces at the discretion of the community organizers and moderators.

# Definitions

Harassment includes:

* Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance, body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, employment, and body modification
* Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
* Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate
* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop
* Threats of violence
* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide
* Deliberate intimidation
* Stalking or following
* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
* Sustained disruption of discussion
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect others
* Publication of non-harassing private communication or photos without consent by the involved parties

Biohack.me prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:
* ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
* Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

# Consequences

Anyone asked to stop any harassing behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Biohack.me organizers may take any action we deem appropriate, up to and including banning from all Biohack.me spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other grinding community members or the general public.
