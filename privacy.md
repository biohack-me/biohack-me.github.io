# Privacy Policy

This policy informs you of the types of personal data we collect from users of Biohack.me, and how we use this data.

We use your personal information only for providing and improving Biohack.me. By using Biohack.me, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

# Information Collection and Use

When using the forums or or contributing other data to our community we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to your email address and username or handle.

We don't run advertising, and we don't sell your data.

All information and communications you submit to and via Biohack.me are stored in a database. Passwords are hashed, but all other data is stored in cleartext. While we do not make a habit of poring through the database to read your personal messages, everyone with database access has access to see them, inclusing our web host, who may look at them without our knowledge if required by U.S. law.

# Log Data

Our web servers collect log data whenever you visit Biohack.me.

This log data may include information such as your IP address, browser type, browser version, the pages of Biohack.me that you visit, the time and date of your visit and other statistics.

We do not monitor these logs using tracking tools like Google Analytics, but may look at the web server logs in order to identify and solve problems that come up.

Our web host also has access to these logs, and may look at them without our knowledge if required by U.S. law.

# Communications

We will not email you unless you explicitly opt-in to recieve notifications from the forums.

# Cookies

Cookies are small files that may be stored in your web browser when you use most websites. Biohack.me uses cookies to keep track of whether or not you are logged in to the forums, and of who you are when editing the wiki. 

You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of Biohack.me.

# Security

The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security, because absolute security does not exist.

# Changes to this Privacy Policy

Updates to this policy may be made from time to time to reflect changes in how we operate, new technologies we adopt, etc. Any updates will take effect immediately upon being posted here, and your continued use of Biohack.me after these updates will constitute your acknowledgment of the changes and your consent to the modified policy.

This policy and all its previous revisions are [available on the Biohack.me github](https://github.com/biohack-me/biohack-me.github.io/blob/master/privacy.md){:target="_blank"}.
